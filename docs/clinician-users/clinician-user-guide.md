## Consent and opt-out

Children and young people or their guardians may choose not to participate in the Epilepsy12 research audit. If they choose to opt out there is a feature created for this which deletes ALL that child/young person's data from the Epilepsy12 database. The empty record is kept to show that a child was added but then removed. All the fields are deleted, and these 'nulled' fields show as `########`.
