## Organisation View, Staff View and Cohort View

### Organisation View

When you first log in, you’ll be taken to the **Organisation View**. Here, you’ll see information about your organisation, the current audit cohort, and real-time summary data for key performance indicator metrics. 

Your organisation details are automatically pulled from the Organisation Data Service. If you are an Lead Clinician, you can navigate between the organisations within your Trust/Health Board. 

The real-time **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboard** is a live report that updates every time a patient’s record is completed. This report allows you to compare your organisation’s performance with your Trust/Health Board, Integrated Care Board (England), NHS Region (England), OPEN UK Region, country, and England & Wales combined. 

If you go into the **Individual Measures tab**, you can see visual comparisons of a single performance indicator across all ICBs, NHS Regions, OPEN UK Regions, and countries. 

### Staff View

To enter the Staff View, click the **View All Epilepsy12 Staff** button in the Organisation View.

Here you will see a list of all the platform user accounts for your Trust/Health Board. You will see each user’s name, email address, role, and organisation. A pink tick indicates that the user is active.

This will display all the children and young people registered to the audit on this platform. You will see each patient's name, sex, and NHS number. If you have started their audit form, you will also see which cohort they are in, and the days remaining to enter data for that cohort.

A blue dot indicates that the record is incomplete. You can also se a progress bar below the **Audit** button. A pink tick means that the record is complete.

Once a record has been completed, you will see a blue cloud button allowing you to submit. This is not necessary, as all completed records will be inlcuded in the audit and the real time performance indicator dashboard. However, by submitting the record, you lock it for editing, allowing you and your colleagues to identify which records have complete data from the first year of care. 

You can un-submit a record by clicking on the blue cloud button again. You do not need to contact the team to un-submit a record.
