## Introduction

The RCPCH Audit Engine is a generic framework for national clinical audits. Its first deployment is as a new platform for the RCPCH's established Epilepsy12 audit, but it is designed to be reusable for other audits in the future.

National clinical audits collect diagnosis and care process data on patient cohorts with a diagnosis in common, nationally, to benchmark the standard of care and feed back to care-giving organisations about their performance. They are a way to make sure that clinics are meeting centrally-set standards, and give clinics feedback on how they are doing. Most national audits such as Epilepsy12 are commissioned by NHS England.

## Epilepsy 12

Epilepsy12 (The UK collaborative clinical audit of health care for children and young people with suspected epileptic seizures) is a national clinical audit established in 2009 and has the continued aim of helping epilepsy services, and those who commission health services, to measure and improve the quality of care for children and young people with seizures and epilepsies. The audit is overseen by a project board and a dedicated project team within the RCPCH.

You can contact the team at: epilepsy12@rcpch.ac.uk or on 020 7092 6157/6056. Dr Colin Dunkley, Consultant Paediatrician, is the current clinical lead for Epilepsy12. 

## Childhood Epilepsy

Epilepsy affects around one in 200 children and young people in the UK (aged 18 and ynder). The condition is one of the most common significant long-term health conditions of childhood. Epilepsy can have a huge impact on children and families. Epileptic seizures can happen at any part of the brain cortex and what happens depends on where in the brain the seizure is happening. Seizures can be distressing but it's not just the seizures that are the problem. Children and young people may experience issues with learning, behaviour and emotions. That's why children and parents need support and guidance from healthcare professionals throughout the stages of diagnosis and treatment. 

## Stated Aims of the Audit

* Continue to measure and improve care and outcomes for children and young people with epilepsies.
* Include all children and young people with a new onset of epilepsy.
* Enable continuous patient ascertainment.
* Use a pragmatic and concise dataset.
* Incorporate NICE Quality Standards alongside metrics about mental health, education and transition to adult services.
* Provide services with local real-time patient- and service-level reporting.

## 10 key performance indicators

1. Paediatrician with expertise in epilepsies
2. Epilepsy specialist nurse
3. a. Tertiary input
3. b. Epilepsy surgery referral
4. ECG
5. MRI brain
6. Assessment of mental health issues
7. Mental health support
8. Sodium valproate
9. a. Care planning agreement
9. b. Care planning content
10. School individual health care plan

## Quality Improvement

Epilepsy12 engaged with relevant stakeholders to identify priority areas of care and agree five Health Improvement Goals to align with these. 

1. Increase the proportion of children receiving input from an epilepsy specialist nurse by 5% per year; from 76% in Cohort 3 to 91% in Cohort 6. 
2. For children with complex epilepsy, increase the proportion receiving input from a tertiary specialist by 5% per year; from 69% in Cohort 3 to 84% in Cohort 6. 
3. Increase the proportion of children receiving all core elements of care planning by 5% per year; from 75% in Cohort 3 to 90% in Cohort 6.
4. Increase the proportion of Health Boards and Trusts using structured transition resources by 5% per year; from 62% in Cohort 3 to 77% in Cohort 6. 
5. Increase the number of Health Boards and Trusts screening children with epilepsy for mental health disorders by 5% per year; from 19% in Cohort 3 to 34% in Cohort 6. 

Epilepsy12 collaborated with QI experts when designing the improvement goals and strategies. We will continue to receive their input when delivering these strategies and seek guidance on how we can  embed Epilepsy12's evaluation and learning to improve the plan and explore avenues of collaboration wth NHS, HQIP, and other improvement programmes. 

You can find out more about our quality improvement plans for 2022-25 in our [Quality Improvement Strategy](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-02/epilepsy12_quality_improvement_strategy_final_0.pdf). 

## National Data Opt Out Implementation (England only)

The Epilepsy12 audit is now exempt from the NHS National Data Opt-Out. Healthcare providers in England no longer need to screen patients against the opt-out list prior to entering their data. Patients can still opt out of Epilepsy12 specifically by contacting their clinical team. You can indicate this in the first year of care form and the record will be deleted. Please take a look at our methodology and data submission page for more information.
